# Hacker News

Hacker News is a React web app designed to allow users to easily search articles with Algolia's Hacker News Search API. Matching articles are filled into a table with links and some basic information.

## Installation

To install Hacker News, simply type `npm install` at the command line.

## Usage

You can launch Hacker News by typing `npm start` at the command line. With the application running, go to http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser to get started.

The search bar can be found at the top of the application, autofilled with 'redux' upon initialization. The table below the search bar displays all the articles matching the query in individual rows. Each row contains the article's title as a clickable link, author, number of comments, and points, in that order. The 'Dismiss' option at the far right of each row allows you to remove that article from the current table.
